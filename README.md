# Linear-Regression-using-Iris-Dataset-

The Iris Dataset is composed of 50 samples representing 3 different species of Iris and 4 features (sepal and petal length & width) (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). A linear discriminant model was built using these metrics to determine how each species should be classified. Data from the set is frequently used as a benchmark for data mining, classification, and clustering examples.

Built the linear discriminant model, which is a good fit for identifying Iris flowers in a sample

Created a supervised machine learning model for the Iris dataset with sklearn and Numpy for matrix manipulation
Results on the Iris Dataset indicate that Neural Networks provide the highest accuracy for classification.
